### Part 3: The "How" - High-Level Architecture & Data Flow

- **Key Question:** How does the system achieve its goal at a high level?
- **Goal:** To sketch out the primary components and the flow of data between them.

### Part 4: The "What" - Deep Dive into Key Components & Technologies

- **Key Question:** What specific technologies and patterns will be used?
- **Goal:** To detail the tech stack, libraries, cloud services, and architectural patterns.

### Part 5: The "Where & When" - Deployment, Operations & Lifecycle

- **Key Question:** Where will this system run and when will it be triggered?
