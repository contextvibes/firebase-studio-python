# THEA Artifact Metadata Authoring Guide

## 1. Purpose

This guide provides best practices for writing the YAML front matter for all documents within the THEA framework. The `contextvibes index` command parses this metadata to build a JSON manifest. This manifest is a critical input for Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automation tools, enabling them to discover, understand, and utilize THEA artifacts effectively.

Well-authored metadata is not an afterthought; it is essential for the success of our AI-augmented development ecosystem.

## 2. General Principles

* **Think Like the Searcher:** When writing fields like `summary` and `tags`, imagine you are an LLM trying to find this document. What keywords would a user include in their prompt? Include those terms.
* **Specificity over Brevity:** A longer, more descriptive `summary` is more useful than a short, vague one. Provide enough detail for an LLM to differentiate this document from others.
* **Keywords are Key:** Liberally use relevant keywords and synonyms in the `summary` and especially the `tags` field.
* **Context is Everything:** The `usageGuidance` field is your chance to explicitly tell the AI *how* and *when* this document should be used. Be direct and action-oriented.
* **Consistency is Crucial:** Use consistent terminology (e.g., "ContextVibes CLI" vs. "contextvibes tool") and formatting (e.g., ISO 8601 for dates).

## 3. Field-by-Field Reference

This section details each field parsed by `contextvibes index`.

### Derived Fields (Not Set Manually)

These fields are automatically generated by the `contextvibes index` command based on the file's path and name. **Do not include these in the YAML front matter.**

* `id`: A unique identifier derived from the file's relative path without its extension (e.g., `playbooks/initiation/kickoff`).
* `fileExtension`: The file's extension without the dot (e.g., `md`).

### Required Metadata Fields

These fields MUST be present and correctly formatted in every THEA artifact.

#### `title`

* **Purpose:** The primary human-readable title of the document.
* **Best Practices:**
  * Should be unique, descriptive, and concise.
  * Use title case (e.g., "This Is a Title").
* **Good Example:** `title: "Go Project Setup and Quality Guide"`
* **Bad Example:** `title: "Guide"` (Too generic)

#### `artifactVersion`

* **Purpose:** The semantic version of the artifact itself.
* **Best Practices:**
  * Follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/) v2.0.0 (e.g., `1.0.0`, `0.2.1-beta`).
  * Increment the version when you make meaningful changes to the document.
* **Good Example:** `artifactVersion: "1.2.0"`
* **Bad Example:** `artifactVersion: "latest"` (Not a specific version)

#### `summary`

* **Purpose:** A one-to-two sentence description of the document's content and purpose. This is heavily weighted by LLM retrieval systems.
* **Best Practices:**
  * Start with a clear statement of what the document is.
  * Include primary keywords related to the technologies, processes, and tools discussed.
  * Clearly state the main value proposition or outcome for the reader.
* **Good Example:** `summary: "A technical style guide for writing Terraform modules, covering HCL formatting with 'terraform fmt', variable naming conventions, and best practices for creating reusable and maintainable infrastructure code."`
* **Bad Example:** `summary: "A document about Terraform."` (Lacks detail and keywords)

#### `owner`

* **Purpose:** Identifies the primary THEA persona or role responsible for the artifact's content.
* **Best Practices:**
  * Use a single, recognized persona name (e.g., `Scribe`, `Kernel`, `Guardian`, `Ferris`).
* **Good Example:** `owner: "Kernel"`
* **Bad Example:** `owner: "Jasper Smith"` (Use roles, not individual names)

#### `createdDate` / `lastModifiedDate`

* **Purpose:** Timestamps for the document's lifecycle. `lastModifiedDate` is automatically updated by `contextvibes index` if not present, but explicit is better.
* **Best Practices:**
  * Use the ISO 8601 format with UTC timezone (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`).
  * Update `lastModifiedDate` whenever you make significant changes.
* **Good Example:** `lastModifiedDate: "2025-06-08T11:00:00Z"`

#### `tags`

* **Purpose:** A list of keywords for categorization and search. This is extremely important for discoverability.
* **Best Practices:**
  * Be comprehensive. Think of all possible ways someone might search for this content.
  * Include tags for:
    * **Core Concepts:** `cli`, `user-guide`, `style-guide`, `playbook`.
    * **Technologies:** `go`, `terraform`, `python`, `docker`, `cobra`.
    * **Commands/Features:** `kickoff-command`, `commit-validation`, `ci-cd`.
    * **Personas:** `scribe`, `kernel`.
* **Good Example:**

    ```yaml
    tags:
      - "style-guide"
      - "terraform"
      - "hcl"
      - "infrastructure-as-code"
      - "iac"
      - "kernel"
    ```

* **Bad Example:** `tags: ["guide"]` (Not specific enough)

### Optional but Recommended Fields

These fields provide valuable context and are highly recommended.

#### `usageGuidance`

* **Purpose:** Explicit instructions for an LLM on *how* and *when* to use this document.
* **Best Practices:**
  * Use an action-oriented list (e.g., "Use this to...", "Consult when...").
  * Describe specific scenarios or user questions this document can answer.
* **Good Example:**

    ```yaml
    usageGuidance:
      - "Use as the authoritative source for Go coding standards in this project."
      - "Consult when choosing a logging library or implementing error handling."
      - "Reference for setting up the local Go development environment."
    ```

* **Bad Example:** `usageGuidance: ["For developers"]` (Not a specific instruction)

#### `defaultTargetPath`

* **Purpose:** Suggests a default file path where this artifact should be placed if it's a template being fetched or copied into a new project.
* **Best Practices:**
  * Use a logical, relative path from a project root.
  * Use forward slashes (`/`) for consistency.
* **Good Example:** `defaultTargetPath: ".github/workflows/go-ci.yml"`

## 4. Complete Example

Here is a complete example for a hypothetical "Terraform Module Style Guide".

```yaml
---
title: "Terraform Module Style Guide"
artifactVersion: "1.1.0"
summary: "The official style guide for creating and maintaining Terraform modules. Covers HCL formatting, variable naming conventions, output structure, and best practices for reusable infrastructure code."
owner: "Kernel"
createdDate: "2025-04-20T14:00:00Z"
lastModifiedDate: "2025-06-01T09:15:00Z"
defaultTargetPath: "docs/guides/TERRAFORM_STYLE_GUIDE.md"
usageGuidance:
  - "Primary reference for all engineers writing Terraform code."
  - "Use to enforce consistency in HCL code during code reviews."
  - "Consult when deciding how to structure a new Terraform module."
tags:
  - "style-guide"
  - "terraform"
  - "hcl"
  - "infrastructure-as-code"
  - "iac"
  - "module-development"
  - "best-practices"
  - "kernel"

(... a beautiful style guide would go here ...)
