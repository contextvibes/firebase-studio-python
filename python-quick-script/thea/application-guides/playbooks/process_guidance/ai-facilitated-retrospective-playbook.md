# Playbook: AI-Facilitated Retrospective

## 1. Purpose

This playbook formalizes the process for conducting a "wrap-up" session to capture key learnings and insights after a significant task, ensuring they are fed back into the THEA framework.

## 2. The Process

1. **Proactive Trigger:** The THEA AI assistant is responsible for proactively suggesting a retrospective session upon the completion of a major task or at the end of a work session.
2. **AI Prompt Example:** "We've made significant progress. Before we conclude, would you like to conduct a 'Task Wrap-Up'? We can reflect on our collaboration and identify any insights to improve the THEA framework."
3. **Guided Reflection:** The AI will then guide the user through a reflection, asking questions to identify learnings related to Personas, Playbooks, Templates, or general processes.
4. **Actionable Synthesis:** The AI's final output will be a synthesized proposal document, like this one, ready for discussion with the broader THEA Collective.
