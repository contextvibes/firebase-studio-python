# THEA Product Framework (`thea/`)

Welcome to the `thea/` directory. This is the **Product** of the repository. It contains the core intellectual property and distributable assets of the THEA (Tooling & Heuristics for Efficient AI-Development) guidance system.

These artifacts are designed to be consumed by developers and AI assistants (like the THEA Collective and ContextVibes CLI) to enhance software development quality and efficiency.

## Directory Structure

The framework is organized into four primary pillars:

### 1. `foundations/`

*   **Purpose:** Contains the "first principles" of the system. This includes core concepts, base schemas (`.json`), foundational research papers, and methodologies that underpin the entire THEA framework.
*   **Key Artifacts:**
    *   `base-schemas/`: Defines the structural contracts (in JSON Schema format) for all other THEA artifacts.
    *   `research-papers/`: Houses foundational research and analyses that inform THEA's design choices.
    *   `concepts/` & `methodologies/`: Explanations of the core ideas behind THEA.
*   **Consumption:** Used by `ContextVibes CLI` for validation, by `Logos` for maintaining structural integrity, and by developers seeking to understand the "why" behind the guidance.

### 2. `building-blocks/`

*   **Purpose:** Contains atomic, reusable assets that are the building blocks for more complex guidance.
*   **Key Artifacts:**
    *   `prompts/`: Standardized prompt templates for a variety of development tasks.
    *   `heuristics/`: Actionable heuristic rules and guidelines that can inform AI analysis or code generation.
    *   `meta-prompts/`: Prompts designed to help users write better prompts.
*   **Consumption:** Used by AI assistants and developers to initiate AI-driven tasks with consistent, high-quality inputs.

### 3. `application-guides/`

*   **Purpose:** Contains practical, user-facing documentation on how to apply THEA. This includes structured, step-by-step guides and processes for utilizing the framework effectively.
*   **Key Artifacts:**
    *   `playbooks/`: Detailed workflows for common development processes (e.g., project initiation, capturing lessons learned).
    *   `guides/`: Specific instructions on topics like metadata authoring and style.
    *   `rulesets/`: Curated collections of prompts and heuristics for specific contexts.
*   **Consumption:** Used by developers and teams to ensure consistent application of THEA's processes and best practices.

### 4. `integrations/`

*   **Purpose:** Contains schemas, example templates, and playbooks specifically for guiding the creation and maintenance of THEA-aligned artifacts in other systems.
*   **Key Artifacts:**
    *   `firebase-studio/`: Resources for building high-quality Firebase Studio project templates that work with THEA.
*   **Consumption:** Used by developers who are extending the THEA ecosystem into other tools and platforms.

## Artifact Manifest

An automated index of artifacts within this `thea/` directory is generated by the `task factory:index` command and stored in `thea/thea-manifest.json`. This manifest is primarily for machine consumption (e.g., by the THEA Collective AI) to discover and understand available THEA resources based on their metadata.

## How to Contribute

Contributions to THEA's guidance are highly encouraged. When adding or modifying content, please adhere to the following:
1.  Place your content in the appropriate directory based on the structure above.
2.  Ensure any new artifacts conform to the relevant JSON schemas defined in `foundations/base-schemas/`.
3.  Follow the authoring rules defined in `application-guides/guides/markdown-authoring-rules.md`.
