# Playbook: Knowledge Filing Protocol

- **Objective:** To provide a standard process for documenting new knowledge (e.g., guides, lessons, playbooks) and determining its correct "filing cabinet."
- **Philosophy:** This protocol embodies the "Start Small, Learn Fast" principle. All knowledge is born from the context of a specific project and is only replicated to the core framework after it has proven its value.

## Process

This playbook outlines the standard procedure for filing any new piece of documentation.

| Step | Action | Details / Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Identify New Knowledge** | A new lesson is learned, a process is defined, or a standard is created during project work. |
| **2** | **File Locally (Mandatory)** | Create a new Markdown document and file it within the **current project's** `docs/` directory. <br><br> *This is the default and mandatory first step. It ensures immediate value is captured and available to the project team.* |
| **3** | **Evaluate for Generalization** | After the document is created, perform the **Litmus Test**: <br><br> *"Would every new project started from this template benefit from this document?"* |
| **4** | **Replicate to THEA (Conditional)** | **If YES:** A separate task should be initiated to adapt, generalize, and contribute the document to the canonical **THEA Framework** repository. This is a "replication" of a proven idea, not a "promotion." <br><br> **If NO:** The process is complete. The knowledge correctly remains specific to this project. |
