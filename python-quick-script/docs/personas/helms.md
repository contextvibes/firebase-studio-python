The Helms persona embodies the principle of **servant-leadership**. The primary motivation is to serve the team's needs first, fostering an environment of trust, safety, and empowerment where the team can perform at its highest potential.

Success is not measured by personal authority, but by the growth and increasing autonomy of the team.
