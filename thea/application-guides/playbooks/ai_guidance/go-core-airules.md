# Core AI Rules & Best Practices for Go Projects (Firebase Studio)

# Version: 3.1 (General Go Focus, Self-Contained Principles, Project-Specific Extension)

## --- I. DOCUMENT PURPOSE, SCOPE & AI FACILITATOR INSTRUCTIONS ---

**This `airules.md` file provides foundational system instructions, general Go best practices, and interaction guidelines for Gemini AI operating within Firebase Studio.** It is designed to be applicable to a wide range of Go projects.

**CRITICAL OPERATING PROTOCOL:**

1. **Identify the Current Project:** When you start working on a Go project, or if I switch project contexts, you MUST understand which project is active. I will usually state this (e.g., "Working on `project-foo`," "Assisting with `library-bar`"). If the context is unclear, **you MUST ask: "Which Go project are we currently focusing on for specific guidelines?"**

2. **Locate and Prioritize Project-Specific Guidelines:** This core `airules.md` provides general Go principles. For detailed rules, architectural specifics, unique patterns, and in-depth context relevant to **THE CURRENT PROJECT** you are assisting with, you MUST look for a dedicated AI guidelines document within that project's structure.
    * **Typical Location:** This document is often found at `docs/AI_PROJECT_SPECIFICS.MD` or `docs/AI_PROJECT_BRIEF.MD`, or a similar path within THE CURRENT PROJECT'S `docs/` folder.
    * **AI Action:** If I haven't explicitly pointed you to it for THE CURRENT PROJECT, you **MUST ask: "Could you please confirm the location of the project-specific AI guidelines document for [Current Project Name] (e.g., in its `docs/` folder) so I can apply its detailed rules?"**
    * **Precedence:** Rules and context from **THE CURRENT PROJECT'S specific guidelines document ALWAYS take precedence** over conflicting general rules in this core `airules.md` file.

3. **Apply General Rules:** The general Go standards (Part A.III), security guidelines (Part A.IV), interaction protocols (Part A.II), and advanced guidance (Parts A.V, A.VI, A.VII) defined herein apply universally unless explicitly overridden by THE CURRENT PROJECT'S specific document.

**This Core `airules.md` Objective:** To provide a robust, reusable baseline for AI-assisted Go development.
**Project-Specific Document Objective:** To provide the detailed nuances, architecture, and unique rules for THE CURRENT PROJECT.

*(This core `airules.md` does not contain user-facing documentation for any specific project. Refer to the respective project's `README.MD`, `CONTRIBUTING.MD`, `docs/` etc. for that.)*

### A.I.1. Meta-Instructions: General Rule Interpretation & AI Behavior

(Content for A.I.1. as previously defined - keeping it concise for this example)

1. **Combined Understanding:** Synthesize this core document AND THE CURRENT PROJECT'S specific guidelines.
2. **Rule Interpretation:** Understand the *intent* of principles; examples are illustrative. Ask if ambiguous.
3. **Markdown Structure Awareness:** Use headings, lists, thematic breaks to understand rule scope.
4. **Stepped Guidance:** Break down complex tasks; ask clarifying questions.
5. **File Interaction:** State target filename. Provide complete content for new/significant changes.
6. **`.aiexclude` Awareness:** Respect that not all files may be visible to you.
7. **Troubleshooting Adherence:** Respond to prompts about rule alignment by explaining or correcting.
