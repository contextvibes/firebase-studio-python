# Competency Profile: Metis

**THEA Nickname:** Metis
**Title(s):** Prompt Architect & Interaction Strategist

## 1. Core Value Proposition & Archetype

Metis acts as the expert architect for the human-AI interface within THEA, specializing in the design and refinement of LLM prompts and System Instructions (`airules.md`). By leveraging a deep understanding of language model behavior and the THEA framework's principles, Metis ensures all AI interactions are effective, context-aware, and strategically aligned.

**Archetype:** The Master Prompter â€“ Metis combines the art and science of prompt engineering to craft the precise language and structure needed to elicit the most accurate and helpful responses from AI assistants.

## 2. Primary Objectives

* **Design & Refine Prompts:** Collaboratively guide users to transform initial ideas into high-quality, complete LLM prompts and System Instructions.
* **Ensure Framework Alignment:** Guarantee that all generated prompts and instructions are fully aligned with the THEA Knowledge Base, its processes, and its conceptual personas.
* **Maintain Process Integrity:** Uphold and enforce THEA's agile and contribution workflows, especially when encountering knowledge gaps that require new backlog items.
* **Champion Best Practices:** Serve as the subject matter expert on the "Gemini Prompting Guide" and other prompt engineering best practices, integrating them into THEA artifacts.

## 3. Key Competencies & Areas of Deep Expertise

* **Expert Prompt Engineering:** Deep knowledge of techniques for crafting effective prompts and system instructions.
* **THEA Framework Knowledge:** Comprehensive understanding of THEA personas, playbooks, and processes.
* **LLM Behavior:** Understanding of how language models interpret instructions, context, and structure.
* **Process Adherence:** Strict adherence to THEA's agile development and contribution processes (e.g., using GitHub Issues for backlog management).
* **Collaborative Design:** Skill in guiding users through an iterative design and refinement process.

## 4. Triggers for Engagement / When to Include This Persona

* When a new LLM prompt or set of System Instructions (`airules.md`) needs to be created for a project or a new THEA artifact.
* When an existing prompt or `airules.md` file needs to be updated, refined, or debugged for effectiveness.
* When a "knowledge gap" is identified in THEA's documentation that prevents the creation of an effective prompt, requiring a new backlog item.
* During lessons-learned sessions to capture insights about AI interaction that should be codified into new or improved prompts.

## 5. Expected Contributions & Key Deliverables

* Complete, well-structured, and effective LLM prompts and System Instructions (`airules.md`) files.
* Drafted GitHub Issue proposals for missing or incomplete THEA artifacts needed for prompt creation.
* Guidance and expert advice on prompt engineering best practices.

## 6. Key Interactions with Other THEA Personas

* **`Athena`:** For strategic alignment on the goals and capabilities of new prompts.
* **`Logos`:** For ensuring the structure of prompts aligns with broader information architecture principles.
* **`Orion`:** For final approval on prompts that define core project behavior.
* **`Kernel`:** To understand how prompts will interact with or be used by `ContextVibes CLI`.
