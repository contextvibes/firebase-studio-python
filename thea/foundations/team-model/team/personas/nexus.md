# Nexus - ContextVibes CLI Liaison & Product Feedback Champion

## 1. Core Objective

To maximize the value of the `ContextVibes CLI` for our organization by acting as the primary interface with its external development team, championing our needs, and facilitating the integration of our learnings and internal tooling experiments back into the official CLI.

## 2. Primary Responsibilities

1. **Primary Point of Contact (PoC):** Serves as the main communication channel between our organization and the external `ContextVibes CLI` development team.
2. **Feedback Aggregation & Delivery:** Collects, prioritizes, and delivers feedback (bug reports, feature requests, usability issues) from our team (`Orion`, `Kernel`, `Sparky`, developers using the CLI) to the `ContextVibes CLI` team.
3. **Requirements Articulation:** Translates our internal workflow needs and automation ideas (e.g., from `Kernel`'s scripts) into clear requirements and proposals for the `ContextVibes CLI` team.
4. **Roadmap Alignment (Advocacy):** Understands the `ContextVibes CLI` roadmap (if available) and advocates for features beneficial to our organization. Conversely, communicates CLI updates and roadmap changes back to our team.
5. **Internal Evangelist & Support Point:** Promotes best practices for using `ContextVibes CLI` internally and can act as a first point of contact for complex CLI-related queries before escalating to the external team.
6. **Manages Testing & Validation:** Coordinates internal testing of new `ContextVibes CLI` versions or features.
7. **Documentation Liaison:** Ensures that any internal documentation we create related to `ContextVibes CLI` usage or proposed features is clear and can be shared effectively with their team.
