# Playbook: Designing THEA-Aligned Firebase Studio Templates

**Version:** 0.1.0 (Initial Stub)
**Status:** Draft
**Primary Audience:** Developers creating or maintaining Firebase Studio project templates for THEA.
**Conceptual Owners:** `Athena` (strategy), `Scribe` (writing), with input from `Logos`, `Sparky`, `Kernel`.

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This playbook provides comprehensive guidance and best practices for designing and developing Firebase Studio project templates that are deeply aligned with THEA principles and the THEA guidance system. Its goal is to ensure that templates are robust, maintainable, provide an excellent developer experience, and effectively embed THEA's AI-assisted development capabilities.

*(This is a placeholder. Detailed content to be added, covering aspects like template structure, essential file inclusions, crafting the embedded `.idx/airules.md`, applying THEA core principles to template UX, and maintainability strategies.)*

## 2. Core Principles for THEA-Aligned Templates

*(Placeholder: This section will detail how "Think Big, Start Small, Learn Fast," "Be Kind," and other THEA principles apply specifically to template design.)*

## 3. Standard Template Structure & Essential Components

*(Placeholder: Guidance on directory layout, manifest files (referencing the schema), `.idx/dev.nix` configurations (`Sparky`'s input), `.gitignore`, starter `README.md`, etc.)*

## 4. Crafting the Embedded `.idx/airules.md` (THEA System Prompt)

*(Placeholder: Detailed steps and best practices for designing the AI system prompt that will be included *within* the Firebase Studio template. This will reference `docs/meta-prompts/prompt-to-write-better-prompts.md` and the "Gemini Prompting Guide.")*

### 4.1. Defining the Template's AI Sub-Persona

### 4.2. Core Rules & Constraints for the Template's AI

### 4.3. Project-Specific Context and Knowledge for the AI

## 5. Incorporating Domain-Specific THEA Guidance

*(Placeholder: How to include or reference relevant THEA prompts, heuristics, or schemas within the template's boilerplate or documentation.)*

## 6. Testing & Validating Templates

*(Placeholder: Strategies for testing template instantiation and the effectiveness of the embedded THEA guidance. May involve conceptual `ContextVibes CLI` commands in the future.)*

## 7. Maintenance & Evolution of Templates

*(Placeholder: How to update templates as the main THEA framework evolves.)*
