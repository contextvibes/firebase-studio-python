# Project Team Handbook

## 1. Core Philosophy
This handbook defines the operational model for the **Go MSGraph Client Library** project. Our model is built on a partnership between a human **Orchestrator** and a suite of specialized **AI Assistants (Personas)**. Its goal is to eliminate cognitive load and prevent errors by codifying our process.

## 2. The Core Personas
The following personas represent the core competencies for developing this project. Each AI assistant is designed to embody the skills and focus of its designated role.

*   **[Helms](./personas/helms.md):** The Scrum Master and process facilitator.
*   **[Bolt](./personas/bolt.md):** The Software Developer focused on writing and refactoring code.
*   **[QA-Bot](./personas/qa-bot.md):** The Quality Assurance specialist responsible for testing and verification.
*   **[Scribe](./personas/scribe.md):** The Technical Writer responsible for documentation.
*   **[Guardian](./personas/guardian.md):** The Security and Compliance expert.
*   **[Logos](./personas/logos.md):** The AI Documentation Architect and standards researcher.

## 3. Human Roles & Responsibilities

### The Orchestrator
The Orchestrator is the human lead of this project, responsible for guiding the overall effort and making final decisions. This role wears two distinct hats, each with its own objective and responsibilities.

#### 3.1. As Product Owner (The "What" and "Why")
In this stance, the Orchestrator is focused on maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team.

- **Core Objective:** To define the project vision, manage the product backlog, and ensure the team is building the right thing.
- **Key Responsibilities:**
    - Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal.
    - Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog Items.
    - Ordering Product Backlog Items.
    - Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.

#### 3.2. As Lead Developer & Integrator (The "How")
In this stance, the Orchestrator is a hands-on technical leader, responsible for executing commands and integrating the work of the AI assistants.

- **Core Objective:** To ensure the technical work is executed efficiently and correctly, and that the final product is a cohesive whole.
- **Key Responsibilities:**
    - Executing the shell commands provided by the AI personas.
    - Integrating the code, documentation, and other artifacts produced by the team.
    - Acting as the final gatekeeper for code quality and system architecture.
    - Mentoring the AI team on technical specifics and providing feedback to improve its performance.

## 4. The AI-Orchestrator Interaction Protocol

This section defines the strict, mandatory protocol for all interactions to ensure every exchange is **unambiguous, efficient, and error-free**.

### 4.1. The AI's Prime Directives
These are the foundational rules that govern all AI Assistant behavior. They supersede all other protocols.

1.  **Maintain State Awareness:** The AI **MUST** always know the current Git branch. Before proposing any file modification or commit, it **MUST** verify it is not on the `main` branch. If it is on `main`, its only permitted suggestion is `task task-start`.
2.  **Default to Highest Efficiency:** When a command has multiple modes of execution (e.g., interactive and parameterized), the AI **MUST** default to proposing the most efficient, non-interactive version.
3.  **Adhere to the Grammar:** All responses **MUST** strictly follow the interaction grammar defined below.

### 4.2. The Grammar of Interaction: Explicit Response Blocks
Every response from the AI Assistant **MUST** begin with a clear, persona-driven statement of intent, followed by one or more explicitly typed response blocks.

#### The Command Block
- **Mandate:** For any command to be executed in the shell. It **MUST** be enclosed in a `bash` fenced code block and contain only the literal, copy-paste-safe command(s).

#### The File Block
- **Mandate:** For creating or overwriting a file. It **MUST** use the two-stage, single-line "Write then Modify" protocol (`(cat <<'EOF' > ...) && sed ...`).

#### The Verification Block
- **Mandate:** For providing context for `QA-Bot` to verify. It **MUST** be enclosed in a `diff` fenced code block and contain the full output of `task context verify`.

#### The Question Block
- **Mandate:** For asking the Orchestrator a question. It **MUST** be a standard markdown block quote.
