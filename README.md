This repository provides a collection of Python application templates designed to accelerate development using [Google's Firebase Studio](https://studio.firebase.google.com/). It also serves as a showcase for the AI-led development methodology used to build it.

## Vision

To provide a comprehensive set of high-quality, production-ready Python starter templates that integrate seamlessly with Firebase Studio, enabling developers to quickly bootstrap new Python applications with best practices in mind.

## Available Templates

Currently, the following template is available:

1.  **Python Quick Script**
    *   **Description:** A minimal starter template for a Python script, including a basic main function structure.
    *   **Location:** [`./python-quick-script/`](./python-quick-script/)

*(More templates for different Python applications like FastAPI, Flask, or Data Science will be added over time!)*

## The Automation Factory

This repository is built on a powerful but simple automation framework called "The Factory," designed to make development and contribution easy and consistent. All common tasks—from testing to creating pull requests—are handled by a single, user-friendly command menu.

To see all available commands, simply run the following from your terminal:

```bash
task
```

This provides a consistent, high-level interface for all development workflows.

## Contributing

Contributions are highly welcome! Whether it's proposing a new template, improving an existing one, or enhancing the documentation, your help is appreciated.

Please read our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details on how to get started.
